üåê MQTT Configuration
The application connects to HiveMQ Cloud with the following configuration:

javascript
const options = {
    username: 'babylon2',
    password: 'TuY-Gv6iM$rx.tX',
    clientId: 'webclient_' + Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 8),
    clean: true,
    connectTimeout: 4000,
    reconnectPeriod: 4000
};
Topic: test/topic Protocol: WSS (WebSocket Secure) Port: 8884

üîß Customization
Adding New Models
javascript
const newModel = {
    url: "path/to/your/model.glb",
    name: "YourModelName",
    position: new BABYLON.Vector3(x, y, z) // Optional
};
models.push(newModel);
Model Management Functions
javascript
// Toggle visibility
toggleVisibility("ModelName");

// Enable/Disable model
setEnabled("ModelName", true/false);
GUI Customization
javascript
// Modify states
const states = ["Aktiv", "Inaktiv", "Wartend", "YourCustomState"];

// Modify names
const names = ["Objekt-001", "YourCustomName"];

// Customize colors
function getStateColor(state) {
    switch(state) {
        case "YourState": return "blue";
        // ... other cases
    }
}
